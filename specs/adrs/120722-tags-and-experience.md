# Should we implement tags and work experience?

## Context and Problem Statement

Our website design initially had a tagging feature and separate work experience page. However, our group is extremely busy and we are running out of time. 

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Time availability
* Whether or not we can build the function with the same quality of the rest of the application given the time constraints.

## Considered Options

* Yes
    * Pros:
      * Will have further functionality
    * Cons:
      * No time
* No
    * Pros:
      * We can spend time on other logistics and quality will be maintained
    * Cons:
      * Less functionality

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We will not implement Tags and Experience, and instead focus on polishing the application.

### Positive Consequences

* Quality is maintained
* We will not be on an unecessarily tight deadline
