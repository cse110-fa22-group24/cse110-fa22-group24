# How should we display the information associated with each job application?

## Context and Problem Statement

Our application's purpose is to help users track their job applications throughout the job application process.
A user may be applying to many different jobs, and each of these job applications will have information associated with it,
such as company, position, status, deadline, location, and other details. We want to figure out the best way to show the user this information,
so that they have all of the information they need without the interface being too visually overwhelming.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Ability to hold a lot of information (many jobs and many fields for each job)
* Provides structure and organization
* Visually appealing

## Considered Options

* Table
  * Pros: highly structured, keeps the user organized
  * Cons: displays all of the information all the time, may be visually overwhelming and impractical, if there are too many fields they may not fit well on one screen
* List
  * Pros: still structured, less information to display on screen (only title and essential information)
  * Cons: forced to omit some information
* List with Dropdowns
  * Pros: maintains structure, visually appealing, allows for all of the information to be included
  * Cons: not all information visable all the time, users have to click to get to details

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: List with summaries always visible, and then expandable dropdowns with more details. This meets our need of displaying a large amount of information in a way that is structured and managable for users to interact with.

### Positive Consequences

* Aesthetically appealing
* Practical for users

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Negative Consequences

* Potential to be unintuitive for users if not well-designed (e.g. if it is not clear that we have dropdowns with more details)
* Will require more code and design/styling
