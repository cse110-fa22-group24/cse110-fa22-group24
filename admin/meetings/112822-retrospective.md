## Sprint Retro Meeting Notes

- Organization
  - A lot of assignments were started late, which resulted in assigments being started late for subsequent weeks
  - We did not do a good job of keeping track of assignments and their due dates
  - We should have a meetings to work on ADRs and user stories
- Communication
  - It was difficult to know what is going on, especially between teams
  - Constrained availability led to difficulty in finding times to meet
  - We should let others know when we are struggling with something or don't have time, so someone else can pick up the slack
- Time constraint
  - Felt like we started coding around week 7-8
  - May cut the profile page feature
  - Will try to add tags
  - Main focus is on getting search and sorting working
  - Will meet soon to write unit tests
- We felt the retro was worth our time
