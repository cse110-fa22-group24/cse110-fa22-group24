## Sprint Retro Meeting Notes

 - Team leads will observe deadlines and checkpoints more closely moving forward.
 - Weekly sprints instead of two-week sprints to increase pace of progress.
 - Set more ambitious goals to make sure we get things done.
 - Current meeting attendance rate is great, we should keep it up!
 - More communication in Slack, updates on what we're working on.
 - Pair programming within teams.
 - We felt the retro was worth our time.
